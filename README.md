# Welcome to the Laughify App! üëã

## üöÄ Built in Just 3 Days!
I learned React Native in 3 days to create this app. Here's what it offers:

1. **Connected to Supabase** for a seamless backend experience.
2. **Email Authentication** for user accounts.
3. **Update Email & Password** functionality for users.

Unfornately I spent too much time figuring out authentication and setting up the database so please refer to the website I made for screenshots:

## üß© Development Notes

Start developing by editing files inside the **`app` directory**. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), which simplifies navigation and code organization.
