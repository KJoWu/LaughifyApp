# Welcome to the Laughify App! üëã

## üöÄ My 3rd Hackathon
I learned React Native in 3 days to create this app. Here's what it offers:

1. **Connected to Supabase** for a seamless backend experience.
2. **Email Authentication** for user accounts.
3. **Update Email & Password** functionality for users.

Unfornately I spent too much time figuring out authentication and setting up the database so please refer to the website I made for screenshots. Opulaugh AI is still a work in progress. 

You can check out PremiumLaughsWithSupaBase to see how I've integrated it with the app. Most of the functionality relies on data sourced from LaughStyle.ts
